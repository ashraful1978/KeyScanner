Question: Does sample pool size impact average time to solve?

inputs:

uint64_t SAMPLE_POOL_SIZE = 1024 * 131072;
uint64_t NET_SIZE = SAMPLE_POOL_SIZE;



notes:

these keygen parms take about 30 seconds to build the 134,000,000 key pool
any results with an r>1, you would be justified to take further average the time by subtracting (r*30seconds)
